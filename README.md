# BranchedPolymerCompaction
A framework to build LAMMPS-friendly branched polymer architectures, and then simulate the coil-globule transition through LAMMPS


## Organization

- `/lams` includes all of the files for running the LAMMPS simulations
- `/data` includes all polymer data, broken down by polymer types and then trial. Only trial2 is available here to preserve storage limits
- `BranchedPolymerAnalysis.ipynb` is the notebook summarizing all commands, including a comprehensive analysis pipeline
